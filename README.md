# react-native-app
 recently,The technology of react-native is very hot,so, I wrote an app for myself, a react-native。 <br/>
 Pack of the generated apk installation package in the Advanced project (integrated redux state management) [Advanced](https://github.com/cryingbat/react-redux-demo),
 and The installation package of android4.4/5.1/6.0 runs smoothly.  <br/> so I hope you can give me more advice.Thank you. <br/>
  The technology stack is involved in the project:[react](https://github.com/facebook/react)+[react-native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native)+[nativebase](https://github.com/GeekyAnts/NativeBase)+[react-navigation](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation)，<br/>
  Third-party components:[native-echarts](https://github.com/somonus/react-native-echarts)+[react-native-actionsheet](https://github.com/beefe/react-native-actionsheet)+[react-native-modal](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-modal)+[react-native-swiper](https://github.com/leecade/react-native-swiper)+[react-native-vector-icons](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons)

 Click on the login store session to enter the home page <br/>
 The homepage has three main sections: front page + news + mine <br/>
 The list of news items I put on the front page supports loading more and drop-down refresh functions.  <br/>
Click on the news to enter the news page.。 <br/>
 The news page has a sliding TAB that supports multi-tab horizontal scrolling. The details are not in place. <br/> 
 My page is a collection of UI components.<br/>

# For beginners, get a quick command of the react-native usage and navigation switch. It has a very big effect. I hope you can study together and make progress together.
